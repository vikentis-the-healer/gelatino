# gelatino
I'm using this project to learn the Godot editor and GDScript. It's meant to be a super simple top-down 2d game where you play as a slime-ish little fella. And, because the tileset I created for it has somehow turned out looking somehow Roman to my eye, apparently the gelatinous protagonist is in Ancient Rome.
